---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**Project Mira** is a **YOLO (You Only Look Once)â€“based AI program** designed to enhance forklift safety in industrial environments. By combining advanced computer vision with real-time sensor integration, this system helps **prevent forklift-related injuries** by detecting humans, obstacles, and foreign objects in the vehicleâ€™s path.  

The program runs on **CUDA-capable devices** such as the **NVIDIA Jetson Xavier**, leveraging its GPU and GPIO ports to directly communicate with forklift electronics (e.g., governors, sirens, and braking systems).  

Inspired by **Teslaâ€™s Full Self-Driving (FSD)** principles, Project Mira provides **real-time perception and autonomous safety intervention** using a combination of **CSI cameras, ultrasonic sensors, mappers, and LiDAR**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Camera Integration**: Supports 1 to 4 cameras for creating a **dynamic birdâ€™s-eye view**.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Uses 1 to 4 sensors for short-range **object detection and mapping**.  
- **3D Mapping**: Employs a mapper to build a **3D HD layout** of the forkliftâ€™s environment.  
- **LiDAR Support**: Optional integration for enhanced accuracy and detection range.  
- **CUDA Acceleration**: Runs on **NVIDIA Jetson Xavier** with CUDA toolkit support.  
- **Active Forklift Control**: Direct GPIO integration allows the system to signal:  
  - Speed governor  
  - Safety siren  
  - Warning lights  
  - Full forklift stop until the obstruction is cleared
